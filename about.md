Hey! My name's Pete.

Professionally, I work on a variety of business-y problems at <a href="https://airtable.com">Airtable</a>. On my off-hours, I serve as a Commissioner on San Francisco's <a href="https://sfpl.org/index.php?pg=2000001901">Library Commission</a>. I also help out with the <a href="https://www.uniteddems.org/">United Democratic Club</a>.

In the past, I was at Northwestern University and <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com">McKinsey & Company</a>, graduating with a BA in Political Science and MS in Computer Science from the first and about a million Marriott points from the second.

During the weekends, you'll find me hiking, watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BonAppetitDotCom">Bon Appetit videos</a>, hunting down any and all desserts, attempting yoga, and reading nonfiction off The New York Times' Notable Books lists (here's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/19/books/review/100-notable-books.html">2018</a>).

This blog is mostly for me, but if it becomes useful for you, then by all means keep stopping by. Here are some topics I'm generally interested in exploring:
* Developing cultures of civic participation and engagement
* Empowering people to find their inner builder
* The process of learning, especially for new skills
* The intersections of technology and policy and of technology and government services
* My operating principles that I feel like I want to write down

I'd love to hear from you: peteh22 [at] gmail
